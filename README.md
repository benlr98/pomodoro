# pomodoro

From scratch pomodoro timer app. Allows users to log in and track time to projects and tasks. Time tracked can be reported on and exported to csv format to load into other timekeeping mediums.

Pomofocus.io has a great website for doing this. I wanted to replicate this with a few additional touches.
